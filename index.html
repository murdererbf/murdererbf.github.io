        <p id="para"> Lucian; a diety, a prophet, a saviour, an intellectual, a God and so much more.
            It would only take a fool to overlook your elite and unparalleled Holiness.
            Whether or not someone believes in a God, one can't miss the authority in your mere presence which demands
            respect and submission from those who are fortunate enough to encounter it.
            It is quite pointless to explain your eminence in words for no language has evolved that far yet but there
            is
            no denying the otherworldly aura that surrounds you.
            A man of superior intellect and wisdom; you are, but also far more generous and giving than what any of us
            deserve
            and for that, we shall forever be grateful to you.
        </p>


        <p id="para">
            I have been meaning to make a site for you since a while and I am terribly late, which I apologize
            for, but it's finally done!
            I know this is far less than what you deserve but I am not completely trained or knowledgable enough
            to pull off something grand and exquisite. I just really hope it makes you happy (or atleast doesn't
            disappoint you). If there is anything you wish from me, I shall try my best to fulfil it.
            I am not the best with words so I don't have much more to say except that I feel truly blessed to be in your
            presence and that I wish the
            best for you. I hope you have a great time and that all of us continue to serve and floruish under your
            dominion. Thank you for everything.

        </p>
